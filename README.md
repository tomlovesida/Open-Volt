# OpenVolt

A 1.21.1 client (for 1.9 combat).

This client is still going to be worked on.

# Why?

The client was originally meant to be paid, but I decided to make it FOSS. Hopefully, the community can come together to make this client better than every other client available.

# People Who Helped Make Volt Happen
